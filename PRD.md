# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project: Temporary File Storage with Optional End-to-End Encryption**

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Project Summary

This project provides a **single-user** file storage web platform where files are uploaded via **external URLs** or upload file from browser, then stored in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for future download.

* Files persist in GCS until manually deleted.
* Files reside in `private/` (authentication required) or `public/` (anonymous access).
* **Minimal design**: no extra metadata, only GCS object name.

The system evolves through phases:

* **Local testing (pre-cloud):** core features â†’ auth â†’ encryption.
* **Cloud phase:** deploy to **Google App Engine (GAE) Standard Environment**.

### 1.2 Deployment Target

* **Platform:** Google App Engine (GAE) Standard (Python 3.13 runtime)
* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
* **Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* **Session:** JWT (stored client-side)
* **Encryption:** Optional AES-GCM, user-supplied key

### 1.3 Authentication

* **Phase 1:** no auth (for dev/testing).
* **Phase 2+:** JWT-based session:

  * Single predefined username and SHA256-hashed password (from environment variables).
  * JWT issued upon login; stored in browser localStorage.
  * All private operations require valid JWT.
* **Public files** remain accessible without authentication.

### 1.4 Application Structure

* Core app logic files reside in **`app/` folder**.
* Project root only contains entry point (`main.py`), config (`app.yaml`), and dependency definitions (`requirements.txt`).

---

## 2. Goals

* Provide a secure, minimal, single-user file storage app.
* Enable uploading from external URLs, or upload file from browser
* list/download/delete/rename file.
* Allow toggling between private/public.
* Provide optional end-to-end AES encryption layer.
* Deploy reliably on GAE Standard.

---

## 3. Non-Goals

* Multi-user support.
* Metadata storage (timestamps, counts, etc.).
* File previews or versioning.
* Advanced key management (KMS, PKI).

---

## 4. Phased Development

### Pre-cloud phase (local testing):

* **Phase 1 â€” Core Logic**

  * Implement file upload, list, download, rename, delete.
  * Implement private/public folder separation.

* **Phase 2 â€” Authentication & Access Control**

  * JWT-based login/logout.
  * Private vs. public file access enforcement.

* **Phase 3 â€” End-to-End AES Encryption** âœ…

  * **Mandatory encryption** for specific endpoints (no fallback):

    * `/files` page â†” `GET /api/files` (encrypted file listing)
    * `/admin` page â†” `POST /api/upload/url`, `POST /api/upload/direct` (encrypted uploads)
    * `/download/private/{file_id}` page â†” `GET /api/download/private/{file_id}` (encrypted downloads)
    * Frontend requires user-supplied AES key with localStorage persistence.
    * User prompted on first use or decryption failures.
    * Backend validates against AES key SHA256 hash from env vars.
    * All payloads use AES-GCM encryption with base64 encoding.

### Cloud phase:

* Deploy to **GAE Standard**.
* Integrate GCS IAM, environment variable management, scaling, HTTPS enforcement.

## 5. System Requirements

### 5.1 Technology Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.13)
* **Deployment:** GAE Standard
* **Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* **Session:** JWT (PyJWT or equivalent)
* **Encryption:** AES-GCM (Web Crypto API + Python `cryptography`)

### 5.2 Functional Requirements

#### 5.2.1 Authentication (Phase 2+)

* User provides username + password.
* Password checked against SHA256 hash stored in env vars.
* On success â†’ backend issues JWT.
* JWT stored in browser localStorage, used in `Authorization: Bearer` headers.
* Token expiry (e.g., 1h). Refresh by re-login.

#### 5.2.2 File Upload

**Method 1: External URL Upload**
* User provides external file URL.
* Backend fetches file, stores in `private/` or `public/`.
* Configurable max file size (default: 200MB).
* Returns object name + file size.

**Method 2: Direct Browser Upload**
* User selects local file via browser file input.
* File uploaded directly from browser to backend.
* Same size limits and storage logic as URL upload.
* Support multipart/form-data uploads.
* Progress indication for large files.

#### 5.2.3 File Listing

* Authenticated users can list files (`private/`, `public/`).
* Show: object name, file size.
* Allow copying download link.

#### 5.2.4 File Download

* **Private files:** require valid JWT.
* **Public files:** available to anyone with link.
* Files streamed directly from GCS.

#### 5.2.5 File Rename

* Authenticated user may rename files (change GCS object name).

#### 5.2.6 Share Toggle

* Authenticated user moves file between `private/` and `public/`.

#### 5.2.7 File Deletion

* Authenticated user deletes files from GCS.

#### 5.2.8 API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
* `POST /auth/login` â€” Authenticate, return JWT.
* `POST /auth/logout` â€” Invalidate JWT (optional).
* `GET /auth/me` â€” Get current user information.

**File Operations:**
* `POST /api/upload/url` â€” Upload from external URL (ðŸ”’ encryption required).
* `POST /api/upload/direct` â€” Upload file directly from browser (ðŸ”’ encryption required).
* `GET /api/files` â€” List files (ðŸ”’ encryption required).
* `GET /api/download/private/{file_id}` â€” Download private file (ðŸ”’ encryption required).
* `GET /api/download/public/{file_id}` â€” Download public file (no auth required).
* `POST /api/rename/{file_id}` â€” Rename file.
* `POST /api/share/{file_id}` â€” Toggle private/public.
* `DELETE /api/files/{file_id}` â€” Delete file.

## 6. Security & Encryption

### 6.1 Standard Security

* HTTPS (GAE provides managed TLS).
* JWT for session management.
* Strong password hash in env vars.
* GCS IAM least privilege.

### 6.2 End-to-End AES Encryption (Phase 3) âœ…

**Implemented for specific endpoints with no fallback options:**

#### Frontend (Web Crypto API)

* User prompted to input AES key on first use.
* SHA256 hash stored in localStorage for persistence.
* Automatic re-prompting on decryption failures.
* AES-GCM encryption with random IV per operation.
* Base64 encoding for encrypted payloads.
* Large file support (up to 250MB encrypted payloads).

#### Backend (Python cryptography)

* AES key SHA256 hash validation from environment variables.
* AES-GCM decryption of client payloads.
* Custom form parser for large encrypted uploads.
* HTTP 400/501 error responses for missing encryption.
* Encrypted responses for all protected endpoints.

#### Risks

* User must remember key (no reset).
* Hard-coded/shared key makes system vulnerable if disclosed.
* Protects against HTTPS interception only, not endpoint compromise.

## 7. Performance & Scalability

* GCS ensures durability and scale.
* GAE Standard: auto-scaling, scale-to-zero when idle.
* File listing queries GCS directly (acceptable scale for single-user).
* Encryption overhead tolerable for â‰¤200MB files.
